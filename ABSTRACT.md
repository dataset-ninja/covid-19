The **COVID-19** dataset is comprised of 3616 positive COVID-19 CXR images, which are collected from different publicly available datasets, online sources, and published articles. A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with ***normal*** and ***viral_pneumonia*** images. This COVID-19, normal, and other lung infection dataset is released in stages. 

In the first release, authors have released 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal, and 1345 viral pneumonia chest X-ray (CXR) images. In the first update, authors have increased the COVID-19 class to 1200 CXR images. In the 2nd update, they have increased the database to 3616 COVID-19-positive cases along with 10,192 Normal, 6012 Lung Opacity (Non-COVID lung infection), and 1345 Viral Pneumonia images and corresponding lung masks. 

Out of 3616 X-ray images, 2473 images are collected from the [BIMCV-COVID19+ dataset](https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/bimcv-covid19/#1590858128006-9e640421-6711), 183 images from a [German medical school](https://github.com/ml-workgroup/covid-19-image-repository/tree/master/png), 559 X-ray images are from the [Italian Society of Medical Radiology (SIRM)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.010), [GitHub](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0010-4825(21)00113-X/sref41), [Kaggle](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0010-4825(21)00113-X/sref42) & [Twitter](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0010-4825(21)00113-X/sref43), and 400 X-ray images from another [COVID-19 CXR repository](https://github.com/armiro/COVID-CXNet). BIMCV-COVID19+dataset is the single largest public dataset with 2473 CXR images of COVID-19 patients acquired from digital X-ray (DX) and computerized X-ray (CX) machines. The major difference between the non-COVID and COVID categories is the lung opacity in the CXR images due to other lung-related diseases and COVID-19, respectively.
